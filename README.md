# SK Uplink

Welcome to SK Uplink, a high-perfomance RabbitMQ communication network for internal communication between the all the different products. It handles updates, CI/CD and distribution of tasks, and functions like an hivemind. Did you upset Apricaria? Well, now Stelleri knows aswell (figure of speech, *or is it?*).

Because a simple `README.md` can only do so much, I have also made an documentation platform, [SK Docs](https://platform.stefankruik.com/documentation). If you are serious about using my products, I highly recommend reading the relevant articles. Don't have time for that? Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://skpvt.io/r/support). I am always open to have a chat and answer questions to your heart's content, unless I am debugging deployment ðŸ˜„.
